* Unless they contain portions of resources distributed under a specific license, my icon creations may be used under the terms of the CC-by-SA license, or the GNU GPL - whichever license is more convenient for you.

Some resources are not official Tango, are of unknown licensing, and are included for completeness; it is my opinion that they are appropriate and of very good quality, both visually and metaphorically. If you are the creator of any of those resources, consider their inclusion to be a compliment to your abilities and not an attack on your intellectual property rights. In the process of collecting all these icons over the years I teh overview of all creators. If you want to get mentioned please contact me.
